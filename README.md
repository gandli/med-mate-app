## Core Value

Big companies do "look it up", we do "manage it":

1. **Multi-drug full-cycle management** (not just single-time drug lookup)
2. **Coverage of both Chinese and Western medicine** (Chinese herbal decoctions, Patent Chinese Medicine, hospital-prepared formulations)
3. **Family collaboration** (children remotely supervise parents medication intake)
4. **Safety detection** (drug interactions + Chinese-Western medicine conflicts + liver/kidney burden)
